        <h1>Undead Asylum</h1>
        <article>
            <p>Starting Hallway - When you gain control of your character, investigate the newly-dumped corpse beside
                you to attain the Dungeon Cell Key. This key unlocks the cell door and allows you to proceed out. This
                leads you into a hallway with Orange Guidance Soapstones (messages left by the developers in order to
                teach you the basic controls and manoeuvres you can perform with your character, you can also use them
                as a guide as they trail to the next objective, in this level) and two unarmed Hollows, who you can
                practice your newly-acquired moves on. They will not fight back so don't be afraid to try everything out
                on them, and get used to the game's mechanics and battle system. As you proceed down the hallway, on
                your right you will get a glimpse of the Stray Demon, an optional boss who you may face upon returning
                to the Northern Undead Asylum. Go through the hallway, and up the stairs.</p>
            <p>
                Courtyard - At the end of the hallway you will come to a waterlogged room with a path on the right
                leading to a ladder. Take the ladder up, proceed out of the room into the open courtyard, and interact
                with the bonfire in the middle of the yard. Bonfires act as the checkpoints of this game. If you die,
                you will respawn at the last bonfire you rested at. You may also perform a plethora of other extremely
                useful actions at bonfires, but for now you may only rest at them (which replenishes your HP, spell
                uses, and cures you of any negative status ailments except for Curse).
            </p>
            <p>
                Big Boss First Encounter - If you explore the courtyard, you will find a gigantic door directly ahead of
                the bonfire and a door on the right side of the area (if facing the gigantic door) which is locked from
                the opposite side. Keep this door in mind for a little later. When you are ready, open the gigantic
                door. The Asylum Demon will fall in and engage you. Here you have two options: you may choose to run
                towards the closed door directly ahead of you and fight the Asylum Demon with just your Straight Sword
                Hilt or bare fists, or you may run to the stairwell on the left side of the room.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that if you choose to fight the Asylum Demon at this point, then you can prepare yourself for a
                long and tedious battle by clicking on it's name for in-depth information about him. Upon his defeat he
                will give you his Demon's Great Hammer and a consumable Humanity item.

        <h1>Firelink Shrine</h1>
        <article>
            <p>The first time you come here will be immediately following your escape from the Northern Undead Asylum -
                you'll be dropped beside a bonfire by the Giant Crow that picked you up at the end of the cutscene. From
                here there are many places you can go right from the beginning of the game, and even more if you chose
                the Master Key as your gift during the character creation process.

                Turn around and you'll see an aqueduct in the distance, which leads to Undead Burg.

                Sat next to the bonfire is a Crestfallen Warrior (He's typical of the type of NPC you'll meet in this
                game - talking in deliberately extraneous language and giving little in the way of hints as to what you
                should do next.) To the left of him you'll find stairs leading down to New Londo Ruins (and possibly
                Valley of Drakes, Blighttown and Darkroot Basin if you have the Master Key and a death wish). Anastacia
                of Astora is also found down these stairs behind some bars, but she can't talk and doesn't serve a
                purpose right now.

                In the doorway to the right of the Crestfallen Warrior you'll find three more doorways leading into some
                ruins: the one on the left leads to The Catacombs via a currently flooded ruin and a graveyard, the one
                in the middle leads to Petrus of Thorolund (a Miracle trainer and leader of the Way of White covenant).
                The right doorway takes you to can find some firebombs at the end of the passage.</p>
            <h2>Looting Firelink</h2>
            <p>
                Upon first arriving you don't have any real alternatives other than to proceed to Undead Burg, since the
                enemies in all the other reachable areas are too challenging to deal with initially. However before
                proceeding to Undead Burg, there are plenty of useful items to collect here in Firelink Shrine.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Near the bonfire you can find a corpse draped over it with Humanity.</li>
                <li>In the right doorway next to the Crestfallen Warrior you can loot some firebombs, as mentioned
                    earlier.</li>
                <li>You can then use the middle doorway to go up the stairs on the right which lead you to two more
                    flight of stairs, at the top of which, you will find a corpse with a Soul of a Lost Undead. Head
                    back down one flight of stairs and take a right to find two doorways that seemly lead nowhere, head
                    into either one and you'll drop down. This will reveal a secret passage leading to an area with some
                    chests containing: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 Cracked Red Eye Orbs</li>
                    <li>Morning Star</li>
                    <li>1 Talisman,</li>
                    <li>6 Homeward Bones </li>
                    <li>4 Lloyd's Talismans</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Drop down off the ledge that these chests are on and you'll find yourself in the graveyard mentioned
                    earlier, where Skeletons will be reforming and readying to attack - it might be advisable to return
                    to the bonfire if you're not confident in defeating them; take a left from here and go up the stairs
                    to find your way back to the bonfire through the flooded ruins.</li>
                <li>Head back to the flooded ruins, out the exit on the left side of it and follow the walls on the left
                    on the outer side next to the cliff edge to find another Soul of a Lost Undead precariously placed
                    here. Go back to the side of the ruins with the path leading to the graveyard, go up the stairs on
                    your right, into the inner balcony of the ruins and follow the walkway around to find yet another
                    Soul of a Lost Undead.</li>
                <li>There's also a load of items in the graveyard to get and they're easily obtainable with a little
                    time investment. Before you go do this, spend your souls at the bonfire (wherever possible) then
                    head to the graveyard. Dash through the skeletons and grab the items as shown on the map below. You
                    will likely die doing this, but once they're looted the items are yours. In 2 or 3 of these suicide
                    runs you can completely empty the graveyard, which gives your inventory a good variety before
                    proceeding to upcoming challenges. Items you find here include: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 Large Soul of a Lost Undead</li>
                    <li>Zweihander</li>
                    <li>Winged Spear</li>
                    <li>Caduceus Round Shield</li>
                    <li>Binoculars</li>
                </ul>
                <li>If you decide to go for the kills with the skeletons, it's advised to use blunt weapons (such as the
                    Morning Star you found earlier) as with one hit you will temporarily "disassemble" the skeletons,
                    making them a little easier to dispatch. You've also got the option to pick up a few other helpful
                    items in two of the surrounding areas, the Valley of Drakes and New Londo Ruins. While totally
                    optional, these items will make the trip through Undead Burg and the next few areas a little easier.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Head down the stairs next to the Crestfallen Warrior from the bonfire, past Anastacia of Astora
                        and down the stairs to an elevator. Stepping on the middle of the platform will take you down to
                        the New Londo Ruins. From here, head down the stairs and search down a small alcove to your left
                        for a soul item. The Hollows that are spread around the area are harmless and won't attack
                        unless provoked. Continue down the slope to your left through a doorway. You'll find a Hollow
                        standing in front of a body holding an Estoc. Down the steps, a clay vase holds a body with two
                        Transient Curses inside. Continue across the bridge in front of you over the water. Near the end
                        of the second bridge, a Ghost will make its way toward you. You won't be able to damage it now,
                        so run past it to the right and toward the wall. As soon as you come to the end of the small
                        wall, double back around the other side through a small doorway. You should see an item in the
                        distance in the water. Here's where you'll need to be quick: There's a thin walkway just under
                        the water that leads out to the item. However, go through will spawn a couple of Ghosts in front
                        of you. Push your way past them before they fully spawn while keeping your footing on the narrow
                        walkway and grab the item, a Fire Keeper Soul. With your treasure in your grasp and the Ghosts
                        ready to engage, leap off the cliff to your death to take the safer and easier route back to the
                        bonfire. </li>
                    <li>This Fire Keeper Soul can be traded with Anastacia of Astora to upgrade your Estus Flask, which
                        lets you recover more hit points per use.</li>
                    <li>If you chose the Master Key, you can explore the Valley of Drakes for a good shield and a sword
                        that works well for faith-based characters.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h2>The Journey to Undead Burg</h2>
            <p>One Step At A Time - Once you've collected the items it's time to go to Undead Burg. From the bonfire
                head past the well and toward the cliff face to find steps that go up by the cliff towards the aqueduct.
                At the top of is a Hollow Warrior and another set of steps with a second Hollow Warrior who will likely
                jump down on or near you, so be careful. After killing those two, it is generally easier to then go up
                the steps to kill a firebombing Hollow Warrior, an axe wielding Hollow Warrior, and another Hollow
                Warrior on the stairs up to the aqueduct. Using lock-ons in this area can be dangerous, so if you are
                having problems try fighting without them.

                Leap - If you head back down the stairs to the lower spot, there is an Undead Soldier (sword) with a
                shield. You'll see an item on the far side of lower level of the aqueduct. You can get it by jumping
                from where you encountered the shielded undead, onto the aqueduct. Once on the aqueduct, carefully make
                your way around the pillars until you reach the other side where you can pick up the Ring of Sacrifice.
                Make your way back around the pillars and jump back onto the cliff where you previously jumped from.</p>
            <p>
                Reaching The Burg - Continue up the two fights of stairs to find an entrance into the aqueduct, and a
                Soul of a Lost Undead at the end of the ledge. Once in the aqueduct, on your left you will find a dead
                end with Sewer Rat will be scurrying next to a corpse with yet another Soul of a Lost Undead. On the
                right is a corridor that you can follow and continue up the stairs on the left to access the Upper
                Undead Burg. You may notice a locked gate at the end of the corridor before heading up, which is
                unlockable later from Lower Undead Burg.

    <section id="undeadBurg">
        <h1>Welcome to Undead Burg</h1>
        <article>
            <p>Having arrived at the rooftop from the Firelink Shrine, through the aqueduct, expect to encounter two
                Armored Hollows. The first wielding a sword and shield, the next an axe. NOTE: As you advance to
                seemingly the only path to available (up the few steps and across the small bridge on the left), you may
                notice some barrels at the end on the right, make a note of this section as we'll come back here later.
                When you cross over the bridge on your left, firebombing Hollow will engage you. There is a fog gate on
                the right and opposite it, a building holding another Armored Hollow (sword and shield). Dispatching the
                Firebomber quickly is key in avoiding a very uncomfortable fight, once you garner the attention of the
                Hollow in the building. When the battle is well and done, you have two options: enter the fog gate, or
                destroy the barrels. This is completely down to you as you will eventually do both, it's just a matter
                of which you'd prefer to do first. </p>

            <p>Barrel Destroyer - This route -is a lot shorter, so I recommend doing it first but it's not a
                requirement- will see the destruction of the barrels mentioned above, which reveals a ledge you can drop
                down to and find a Large Soul of a Lost Undead. You can drop down once again into an ally where a Hollow
                patrols the area, if he spots you he will either run away or attack you. Should he run away, don't chase
                after him as he may lead you to a sticky situation if you're not careful, but be ready to fight up to
                three of them. Once on the ground, take the door on your immediate left. Up the stairs you will find
                another corpse with a Soul of a Lost Undead. Head back out to the ally and take a right and proceed. In
                the even you haven't triggered them during your confrontation with the patrolling Hollow, two more will
                be hanging on the other side of a wall and will climb over to attack you once you are close to them.
                Dispose of them and make your way into the building on your right, past the bridge. From the other door,
                you will see an item on a corpse outside. Be warned that this is a trap - there are more of those
                hanging hollows on the right waiting for you to come close, four in total. HINT: There are two hollows
                hanging on your immediate right. You can strike their hands to make them drop before they have a chance
                to climb over. Once they're dead, you may proceed to the corpse and loot some Rubbish (Note: despite the
                name, this item can eventually be traded to a character named Snuggly for a nice item, so ensure you
                pick it up). Head straight ahead, up the ladder, and follow walkway to the end to find Humanity on a
                corpse. Turn around and drop down at the broken section of the walkway to find yourself back at the
                rooftop. This time proceed through the fog gate. </p>
            <p>
                Into the Fog - Enter the fog gate. Under the stairs on the left, rests a corpse with a Soul of a Lost
                Undead. Head up the stairs to find two doors; one with a broken wooden bridge that leads into another
                door that is impossible to access from here - don't worry, we'll find another way around. Should you
                try, you would fall back onto the roof of the aqueduct. The other door leads up a flight of stairs, into
                an outdoor wall walk. Reaching the top of the stairs, a large dragon known as the Hellkite Drake, will
                crash down overhead. Move back quickly and put your shield up once you hear him, as it can hurt/kill you
                should it connect. It'll only be there for a moment before it flies off. Once it does, continue up the
                steps in the same direction,. In the distance you may spot some enemies, the two closest to you are of
                your primary concern, although there should be a total of 4 Hollows in that will engage you (1 Archer, 3
                sword & shield). The Hollow Archer will draw its bow and target you from a distance while the melee
                Armored Horrows engage you. There are two Hollows hiding behind the wooden barriers ahead, and one
                standing near to the archer. To avoid unnecessary arrow damage, you can try to lure the sword-wielding
                Hollows down the steps you just came from, removing you from the line of sight of the archer and
                enabling you to defeat them easily. Once done, head across the courtyard, up the stairs and deal with
                the archer (Note: You may notice, a door on the structure directly under where the archer was shooting.
                If you have the masterkey, you can enter the space to find a Wooden Shield on the corpse, on the
                balcony. At the top of the stairs on your left there's a room with a bonfire - but since we have cleared
                out a lot of enemies it may be best not to use it just yet, but the choice is ultimately yours.
            </p>
            <h2>EXploring Around the First Bonfire</h2>
            <p>
                Into the fog Pt 2 - Head back down to the courtyard to find two spear wielding Undead Soldier, on your
                left. These guys are tough to take out once their shields are raised, so it is advised that you use a
                ranged attack to take them out one at a time. Kicking while their guard is up will stagger them and
                leave them open to attack. If you have any Pyromancies such as the starting fireball pyromancy, or some
                firebombs, you can kill them with a single shot by standing at a middle distance and lobbing the spell
                or firebomb so it arcs beneath their shield and hits their legs. This is a useful tactic with many
                shielded enemies, so it is worth practising a bit by resetting these two soldiers a few times via the
                bonfire. If you are lucky they may also drop a Hollowed Shield. Just be careful not to be surprised by a
                sudden spear thrust, as the two soldiers will occasionally turn aggressive or even leap at you.

                Into the fog Pt 3 - Once the two spear wielding Hollows are dead, head over and destroy the boxes
                initially behind them to reveal stairs leading downwards. Down the stairs, the door ahead will lead
                outside where you will find the Undead Merchant. Before you go talk to him, turn right and just on the
                other side of the fireplace is an axe wielding Hollow hiding behind some cabinets. Kill him now to
                ensure your safety when dealing with the merchant. The merchant has some useful items for sale. The
                Residence Key (if you haven't got the Master Key) and the Bottomless Box are incredibly useful. Other
                good items he sells include: Firebombs, a Short Bow, and Repair Powder (Note: If you can't afford them,
                doing few runs from the merchant to the bonfire, collecting the souls of the Harrows you dispatch, to
                enable your purchases). Also, you can kill the Undead Merchant, which rewards you with the Uchigatana,
                however it is not recommended as he can sell you a lot more. Head back inside from the merchant's
                balcony and turn left into a corridor then down the stairs and at the back of the resulting alleyway
                there will be four shield-less Hollows. Take care of them and continue down the ally to climb the
                ladder. You'll end up at rooftop where you will find a corpse with Throwing Knives (x10). Straight ahead
                you will see the doorway with the broken wooden bridge. Where earlier it wasn't possible to run jump
                onto it, here it is. Once you do, head up the stairs onto the ledge to find Light Crossbow and some
                Standard Bolts (x16) on a corpse. Jump off this ledge through the gap in the railing and you'll be back
                on the rooftop where you entered Undead Burg. If you haven't already, you can now proceed to destroy the
                barrels and the route that follows.

            <h2>Beyond the First Bonfire</h2>
            <p>
                Battlefield - If you head back to the bonfire room, on your left there is a bridge, but be warned that
                there will be three FireBomber Hollows at you from above (one is behind the church tower) as you
                approach and cross it. You can try and shoot them out if you have a crossbow or a bow, but that may take
                some practice so it's highly recommended to just sprint through and keep as far right as possible. Once
                you enter the doorway at the other end, you'll be out of range of the fire bombs but will encounter two
                axe Hollows and an Undead Soldier (sword). Also be aware that one or two of the firebomb hollows from
                earlier may have dropped down here. (Note: This door will already be open the next time you come here
                and you should travel a small section of the bridge to lure the undead soldier across the bridge toward
                you and once he is gone you can then proceed onwards and get rid of the axe hollows.) You will also
                notice a locked gate in this room that you will be able to unlock it a bit later from Lower Undead Burg.

                Head out the door and take the next door on your right into a building. On your immediate right a Hollow
                will attack. Go straight through to reveal another armed Hollowon your immediate left. Back in the first
                room will be some stairs to another room on the left. In here, a chest holds Black Firebombs (x5). Head
                back outside and ascend the stairs on the right into an area with three more aggro Hollows, one of which
                throws Firebombs. After you have disposed of them, there will be a ladder to the left of the stairs you
                came from. Once ascended, you'll find the three Firebombers that tried to kill you earlier when crossing
                the bridge, and you can kindly return the favour. There will be a corpse up here with Soul of a Lost
                Undead. Head back down the ladder and enter the small tower on your left to silence the archer Hollow
                atop.

                Back downstairs there is a building on your right that you can unlock with the Residence Key (or the
                Master Key). Head through to find a chest containing Gold Pine Resin (x3). If you have a ranged weapon,
                you can take care of the three Undead Soldiers that are visible from here. If not, drop down off the
                ledge here and engage them. Here you will see some stairs leading down, and some leading up:

                The Darkest Knight Brings The Lightest Loot - The downward stairs lead to the intimidating sight of a
                Black Knight, but luckily he has his back to you. At such an early stage in the game these guys are
                tough, but if you are feeling brave you can attempt to take him on - be warned however that at low
                levels a straight melee fight will be a challenge. If you lure him out and run back to the ladder that
                lead up to the firebomb Hollows, he won't be able to follow you up the ladder and will give you an
                opportunity to kill him through ranged attacks - firebombs work well for all character types. If you
                have experienced summons with you, they may also be able to handle him for you. He will drop a Titanite
                Chunk and possibly other valuable items such as a Black Knight Sword or Shield once killed. Past where
                you met the Black Knight you will find the Blue Tearstone Ring.
            </p>
            <p>
                Undead Donkey Kong - The upward stairs leads toward a tower, but proceed carefully because at the top
                there is an Undead Soldier waiting to roll a flaming barrel down the stairs once you take the second
                flight of stairs. There is a broken section in the wall you can drop down (carefully) to avoid the trap
                - once the trap is set off, it does not reset. Alternatively, go just far enough up the stairs to set
                off the rolling barrel, and then run back down around the corner. Once the trap is sprung and the Undead
                Soldier is defeated, head up the stairs into the tower.
            </p>
            <h2>The Taurus Demon's Tower</h2>
            <p>
                Rock Bottom - Inside the tower you'll find a door straight ahead of you that can be opened with the
                Master Key but it's best to avoid this area for now because Havel The Rock is waiting downstairs,
                although if you have summoned spirits with you it is worth a try. Even if you manage to defeat him,
                there's only a locked door down here (it opens as a shortcut between Undead Burg and Darkroot Basin
                later in the game), so you will have to go up to proceed regardless of if you decide to take him on or
                not. Note: If you do decide to try your luck with our friend Havel, be weary. If he hits you with his
                weapon, which is a dragon's tooth - yeah, you're in trouble -, you are dead regardless of your shield,
                or anything; conserve your stamina and use it to mainly roll out of the way of his attacks.
            </p>
            <p>Mess With The Bull... - Head up the stairs until you are two floors up from the tower's entrance and then
                take out the barrels here to reveal a Crystal Lizard which you should quickly dispatch to receive some
                Twinkling Titanite and another random Titanite drop. Proceed to the fog gate and through it, find
                yourself on some battlements with another gate at the end, but don't cross the bridge yet. Ascend the
                ladder on your immediate right instead to find two Hollow archers (with swords) that will attack you
                once you reach the top. Kill them then go back down again and start crossing over. About three quarters
                of the way across the bridge, a monster will come crashing down in front of you...</p>
            <h2>Meeting Solaire</h2>
            <p>
                Sun Of A Gun - After defeating the Taurus Demon, head through the fog gate at the end of the boss arena.
                There are stairs leading down but before heading down, destroy the boxes at the end to find a Large Soul
                of a Lost Undead. At the bottom, you will see the locked door that will lead you to Lower Undead Burg -
                you'll find the key later. To your left there's a wide and long bridge with some enemies on it, and if
                you continue to the right you'll find Solaire of Astora out on the platform looking at the sun. Praise
                the Sun! If you answer YES to all his questions he will give you White Sign Soapstone - giving you the
                ability to join co-op with other players to help take on bosses in their world.
            </p>
            <h2>The Wyvern Bridge</h2>
            <p>
                Can You Handle The Heat? - Go back to the long bridge with the enemies and proceed across it. If the
                Drake is not at the end, it will come flying from behind - either way, there will be loads of fire when
                you are about halfway across the bridge. There are two openings ahead, one on the left and another on
                the right. The one on the right has some stairs going down - that is the one you want to aim for. Raise
                your shield and start running towards the stairs on the right of the bridge, hugging the right side of
                the bridge as you go. Ignore the enemies but avoid the arrows since they will slow you down. As
                mentioned, about halfway across the Drake will spew fire, killing all the enemies (and hopefully not
                you). Hint: The Heater Shield (purchasable from the Undead Merchant in Undead Burg) and its increased
                fire resistance may prove useful here if you are having difficulty making it across. Head down the
                stairs and you will see two doors. One leads under the bridge and the other is a shortcut to your last
                visited bonfire. Take the one back to the bonfire first and note that you will need to kick down a
                ladder to open a way back up. IMPORTANT: Make sure you kick down the ladder first to open the shortcut
                for good. Once this is done, go back up and take the other door that leads under the bridge.

                Down here you can obtain a weapon that's very useful for low level characters: the Drake Sword. You
                obtain it by shooting the Drake's tail multiple times with arrows from below the bridge on the right
                side until it breaks off. Note: Once done, you should be aware that there are three ways you can
                proceed. One way will allow you to go under the bridge, ignoring the Drake and the other two ways will
                require you to either run past or kill the Drake, but these methods will open up a shortcut to the
                Undead Parish, a bonfire and a covenant (the Warrior of Sunlight covenant - read up on this covenant to
                find out how to join):
            </p>
            <p>
                Method 1 - Under the Bridge: While under the bridge, go around the pillars. Past the second one an
                Undead Soldier (sword) lurks. Take the path to the left of the last pillar and you will see a Undead
                Soldier (spear) patrolling. Past him you will see a door leading into a room. This part can be tricky
                since three poisonous sewer rats will rush you (and possibly knock you off the edge if you're not
                careful). Either try lure them out or rush inside and get rid of them. They are poisonous, so proceed
                with caution and keep that shield up. (Should you get poisoned, don't freak out. Being poisoned will
                only drain HP slowly, so if you just keep an eye on your health and use flasks when you need to you
                should be okay. Return to the bonfire to remove the poison and try again) Once inside the rat room, you
                can climb a ladder on your left to reach the Undead Parish.
            </p>
            <p>
                Method 2 - Running Past the Drake on top of the Bridge: You can brave a sprint straight through to the
                passage below where the Wyvern sits, but this might be a tall order and having high fire resistance is
                recommended. So if you sprint from the top of the stairs on the bridge towards the other safe zone on
                the left side, it will usually cause the Drake to breathe fire, helping you with any remaining Hollows
                in the area. Then simply wait in the other safe zone until the Drake gets bored (usually takes no more
                than 20 seconds) and it will leap down onto the bridge. Alternatively, shooting an arrow at it from the
                stairs will make it leap down right away. The second it does this, quickly bolt through its legs towards
                the doorway behind it. It's worth trying to pick up the Claymore on the corpse on the right as you run.
                If you make it through it is possible that the Drake may turn around and breathe fire into that area, so
                if you want to be safe you can hang a sharp right in the passage and run out the door here. Pulling the
                lever in there will make the Drake fly away and open a shortcut to Undead Parish. There is also a
                bonfire in here and a doorway leading to the covenant mentioned above. Enter the Undead Parish through
                the newly-opened gate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Method 3 - Defeating the Drake: There are a number of ways to kill the Hellkite Drake (as further
                detailed on its discussion page), including moving to the left side under the bridge and shooting it in
                the neck with arrows as it patrols back and forth. (With the Patch this method has been fixed, the Drake
                heals, when health drops by 25%.) However, if you prefer melee, then what follows is also a viable
                option - but will likely take a few tries to perfect, so don't be discouraged if you die a few times.
                Stand at the top of the stairs to the side of the bridge so you can see the Drake's head, shoot it with
                an arrow to make it jump down and then ready your preferred weapon (ideally the Drake Sword), holding it
                two-handed. As soon as the arrow hits (and not before) start running out to the middle of the bridge and
                do a jump attack. The Drake will have come down to you by the time your strike lands and it will
                hopefully hit him right in the head, taking off a chunk of his health. As soon as you can, run back and
                down the stairs to avoid his attack and wait down there for him to go back up to his perch. Repeat this
                process a few times and he'll eventually expire, giving you a load of souls, allowing you to traverse
                bridge at your leisure, letting you pick up the items and get to the room at the back to access the
                bonfire and covenant. Pull the lever and go through the gate to enter the Undead Parish.


                Whichever method you decide to use, you'll be at the Undead Parish once you're done.
