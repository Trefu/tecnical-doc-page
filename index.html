                <p><u>Starting Hallway</u> - When you gain control of your character, investigate the newly-dumped
                    corpse
                    beside
                    you to attain the Dungeon Cell Key. This key unlocks the cell door and allows you to proceed out.
                    This
                    leads you into a hallway with Orange Guidance Soapstones (messages left by the developers in order
                    to
                    teach you the basic controls and manoeuvres you can perform with your character, you can also use
                    them
                    as a guide as they trail to the next objective, in this level) and two unarmed Hollows, who you can
                    practice your newly-acquired moves on. They will not fight back so don't be afraid to try everything
                    out
                    on them, and get used to the game's mechanics and battle system. As you proceed down the hallway, on
                    your right you will get a glimpse of the Stray Demon, an optional boss who you may face upon
                    returning
                    to the Northern Undead Asylum. Go through the hallway, and up the stairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <u>Courtyard</u> - At the end of the hallway you will come to a waterlogged room with a path on the
                    right
                    leading to a ladder. Take the ladder up, proceed out of the room into the open courtyard, and
                    interact
                    with the bonfire in the middle of the yard. Bonfires act as the checkpoints of this game. If you
                    die,
                    you will respawn at the last bonfire you rested at. You may also perform a plethora of other
                    extremely
                    useful actions at bonfires, but for now you may only rest at them (which replenishes your HP, spell
                    uses, and cures you of any negative status ailments except for Curse).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u>Big Boss First Encounter</u> - If you explore the courtyard, you will find a gigantic door
                    directly
                    ahead of
                    the bonfire and a door on the right side of the area (if facing the gigantic door) which is locked
                    from
                    the opposite side. Keep this door in mind for a little later. When you are ready, open the gigantic
                    door. The Asylum Demon will fall in and engage you. Here you have two options: you may choose to run
                    towards the closed door directly ahead of you and fight the Asylum Demon with just your Straight
                    Sword
                    Hilt or bare fists, or you may run to the stairwell on the left side of the room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that if you choose to fight the Asylum Demon at this point, then you can prepare yourself for a
                    long and tedious battle by clicking on it's name for in-depth information about him. Upon his defeat
                    he
                    will give you his Demon's Great Hammer and a consumable Humanity item.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first time you come here will be immediately following your escape from the Northern Undead
                    Asylum - you'll be dropped beside a bonfire by the Giant Crow that picked you up at the end of the
                    cutscene.
                    From
                    here there are many places you can go right from the beginning of the game, and even more if you
                    chose
                    the Master Key as your gift during the character creation process.

                    Turn around and you'll see an aqueduct in the distance, which leads to Undead Burg.

                    Sat next to the bonfire is a Crestfallen Warrior (He's typical of the type of NPC you'll meet in
                    this
                    game - talking in deliberately extraneous language and giving little in the way of hints as to what
                    you
                    should do next.) To the left of him you'll find stairs leading down to New Londo Ruins (and possibly
                    Valley of Drakes, Blighttown and Darkroot Basin if you have the Master Key and a death wish).
                    Anastacia
                    of Astora is also found down these stairs behind some bars, but she can't talk and doesn't serve a
                    purpose right now.

                    In the doorway to the right of the Crestfallen Warrior you'll find three more doorways leading into
                    some
                    ruins: the one on the left leads to The Catacombs via a currently flooded ruin and a graveyard, the
                    one
                    in the middle leads to Petrus of Thorolund (a Miracle trainer and leader of the Way of White
                    covenant).
                    The right doorway takes you to can find some firebombs at the end of the passage.</p>
                <h2>Looting Firelink</h2>
                <p>
                    Upon first arriving you don't have any real alternatives other than to proceed to Undead Burg, since
                    the
                    enemies in all the other reachable areas are too challenging to deal with initially. However before
                    proceeding to Undead Burg, there are plenty of useful items to collect here in Firelink Shrine.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Near the bonfire you can find a corpse draped over it with Humanity.</li>
                    <li>In the right doorway next to the Crestfallen Warrior you can loot some firebombs, as mentioned
                        earlier.</li>
                    <li>You can then use the middle doorway to go up the stairs on the right which lead you to two more
                        flight of stairs, at the top of which, you will find a corpse with a Soul of a Lost Undead. Head
                        back down one flight of stairs and take a right to find two doorways that seemly lead nowhere,
                        head
                        into either one and you'll drop down. This will reveal a secret passage leading to an area with
                        some
                        chests containing: </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4 Cracked Red Eye Orbs</li>
                        <li>Morning Star</li>
                        <li>1 Talisman,</li>
                        <li>6 Homeward Bones </li>
                        <li>4 Lloyd's Talismans</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Drop down off the ledge that these chests are on and you'll find yourself in the graveyard
                        mentioned
                        earlier, where Skeletons will be reforming and readying to attack - it might be advisable to
                        return
                        to the bonfire if you're not confident in defeating them; take a left from here and go up the
                        stairs
                        to find your way back to the bonfire through the flooded ruins.</li>
                    <li>Head back to the flooded ruins, out the exit on the left side of it and follow the walls on the
                        left
                        on the outer side next to the cliff edge to find another Soul of a Lost Undead precariously
                        placed
                        here. Go back to the side of the ruins with the path leading to the graveyard, go up the stairs
                        on
                        your right, into the inner balcony of the ruins and follow the walkway around to find yet
                        another
                        Soul of a Lost Undead.</li>
                    <li>There's also a load of items in the graveyard to get and they're easily obtainable with a little
                        time investment. Before you go do this, spend your souls at the bonfire (wherever possible) then
                        head to the graveyard. Dash through the skeletons and grab the items as shown on the map below.
                        You
                        will likely die doing this, but once they're looted the items are yours. In 2 or 3 of these
                        suicide
                        runs you can completely empty the graveyard, which gives your inventory a good variety before
                        proceeding to upcoming challenges. Items you find here include: </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 Large Soul of a Lost Undead</li>
                        <li>Zweihander</li>
                        <li>Winged Spear</li>
                        <li>Caduceus Round Shield</li>
                        <li>Binoculars</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>If you decide to go for the kills with the skeletons, it's advised to use blunt weapons (such as
                        the
                        Morning Star you found earlier) as with one hit you will temporarily "disassemble" the
                        skeletons,
                        making them a little easier to dispatch. You've also got the option to pick up a few other
                        helpful
                        items in two of the surrounding areas, the Valley of Drakes and New Londo Ruins. While totally
                        optional, these items will make the trip through Undead Burg and the next few areas a little
                        easier.
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Head down the stairs next to the Crestfallen Warrior from the bonfire, past Anastacia of
                            Astora
                            and down the stairs to an elevator. Stepping on the middle of the platform will take you
                            down to
                            the New Londo Ruins. From here, head down the stairs and search down a small alcove to your
                            left
                            for a soul item. The Hollows that are spread around the area are harmless and won't attack
                            unless provoked. Continue down the slope to your left through a doorway. You'll find a
                            Hollow
                            standing in front of a body holding an Estoc. Down the steps, a clay vase holds a body with
                            two
                            Transient Curses inside. Continue across the bridge in front of you over the water. Near the
                            end
                            of the second bridge, a Ghost will make its way toward you. You won't be able to damage it
                            now,
                            so run past it to the right and toward the wall. As soon as you come to the end of the small
                            wall, double back around the other side through a small doorway. You should see an item in
                            the
                            distance in the water. Here's where you'll need to be quick: There's a thin walkway just
                            under
                            the water that leads out to the item. However, go through will spawn a couple of Ghosts in
                            front
                            of you. Push your way past them before they fully spawn while keeping your footing on the
                            narrow
                            walkway and grab the item, a Fire Keeper Soul. With your treasure in your grasp and the
                            Ghosts
                            ready to engage, leap off the cliff to your death to take the safer and easier route back to
                            the
                            bonfire. </li>
                        <li>This Fire Keeper Soul can be traded with Anastacia of Astora to upgrade your Estus Flask,
                            which
                            lets you recover more hit points per use.</li>
                        <li>If you chose the Master Key, you can explore the Valley of Drakes for a good shield and a
                            sword
                            that works well for faith-based characters.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <h2>The Journey to Undead Burg</h2>
                <p><u> One Step At A Time</u> - Once you've collected the items it's time to go to Undead Burg. From the
                    bonfire
                    head past the well and toward the cliff face to find steps that go up by the cliff towards the
                    aqueduct.
                    At the top of is a Hollow Warrior and another set of steps with a second Hollow Warrior who will
                    likely
                    jump down on or near you, so be careful. After killing those two, it is generally easier to then go
                    up
                    the steps to kill a firebombing Hollow Warrior, an axe wielding Hollow Warrior, and another Hollow
                    Warrior on the stairs up to the aqueduct. Using lock-ons in this area can be dangerous, so if you
                    are
                    having problems try fighting without them.

                    Leap - If you head back down the stairs to the lower spot, there is an Undead Soldier (sword) with a
                    shield. You'll see an item on the far side of lower level of the aqueduct. You can get it by jumping
                    from where you encountered the shielded undead, onto the aqueduct. Once on the aqueduct, carefully
                    make
                    your way around the pillars until you reach the other side where you can pick up the Ring of
                    Sacrifice.
                    Make your way back around the pillars and jump back onto the cliff where you previously jumped from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u>Reaching The Burg</u> - Continue up the two fights of stairs to find an entrance into the
                    aqueduct, and
                    a
                    Soul of a Lost Undead at the end of the ledge. Once in the aqueduct, on your left you will find a
                    dead
                    end with Sewer Rat will be scurrying next to a corpse with yet another Soul of a Lost Undead. On the
                    right is a corridor that you can follow and continue up the stairs on the left to access the Upper
                    Undead Burg. You may notice a locked gate at the end of the corridor before heading up, which is

                <p>Having arrived at the rooftop from the Firelink Shrine, through the aqueduct, expect to encounter two
                    Armored Hollows. The first wielding a sword and shield, the next an axe. NOTE: As you advance to
                    seemingly the only path to available (up the few steps and across the small bridge on the left), you
                    may
                    notice some barrels at the end on the right, make a note of this section as we'll come back here
                    later.
                    When you cross over the bridge on your left, firebombing Hollow will engage you. There is a fog gate
                    on
                    the right and opposite it, a building holding another Armored Hollow (sword and shield). Dispatching
                    the
                    Firebomber quickly is key in avoiding a very uncomfortable fight, once you garner the attention of
                    the
                    Hollow in the building. When the battle is well and done, you have two options: enter the fog gate,
                    or
                    destroy the barrels. This is completely down to you as you will eventually do both, it's just a
                    matter
                    of which you'd prefer to do first. </p>

                <p><u>Barrel Destroyer</u> - This route -is a lot shorter, so I recommend doing it first but it's not
                    a
                    requirement- will see the destruction of the barrels mentioned above, which reveals a ledge you can
                    drop
                    down to and find a Large Soul of a Lost Undead. You can drop down once again into an ally where a
                    Hollow
                    patrols the area, if he spots you he will either run away or attack you. Should he run away, don't
                    chase
                    after him as he may lead you to a sticky situation if you're not careful, but be ready to fight up
                    to
                    three of them. Once on the ground, take the door on your immediate left. Up the stairs you will find
                    another corpse with a Soul of a Lost Undead. Head back out to the ally and take a right and proceed.
                    In
                    the even you haven't triggered them during your confrontation with the patrolling Hollow, two more
                    will
                    be hanging on the other side of a wall and will climb over to attack you once you are close to them.
                    Dispose of them and make your way into the building on your right, past the bridge. From the other
                    door,
                    you will see an item on a corpse outside. Be warned that this is a trap - there are more of those
                    hanging hollows on the right waiting for you to come close, four in total. HINT: There are two
                    hollows
                    hanging on your immediate right. You can strike their hands to make them drop before they have a
                    chance
                    to climb over. Once they're dead, you may proceed to the corpse and loot some Rubbish (Note: despite
                    the
                    name, this item can eventually be traded to a character named Snuggly for a nice item, so ensure you
                    pick it up). Head straight ahead, up the ladder, and follow walkway to the end to find Humanity on a
                    corpse. Turn around and drop down at the broken section of the walkway to find yourself back at the
                    rooftop. This time proceed through the fog gate. </p>
                <p>
                    <u>Into the Fog</u> - Enter the fog gate. Under the stairs on the left, rests a corpse with a Soul
                    of a
                    Lost
                    Undead. Head up the stairs to find two doors; one with a broken wooden bridge that leads into
                    another
                    door that is impossible to access from here - don't worry, we'll find another way around. Should you
                    try, you would fall back onto the roof of the aqueduct. The other door leads up a flight of stairs,
                    into
                    an outdoor wall walk. Reaching the top of the stairs, a large dragon known as the Hellkite Drake,
                    will
                    crash down overhead. Move back quickly and put your shield up once you hear him, as it can hurt/kill
                    you
                    should it connect. It'll only be there for a moment before it flies off. Once it does, continue up
                    the
                    steps in the same direction,. In the distance you may spot some enemies, the two closest to you are
                    of
                    your primary concern, although there should be a total of 4 Hollows in that will engage you (1
                    Archer, 3
                    sword & shield). The Hollow Archer will draw its bow and target you from a distance while the melee
                    Armored Horrows engage you. There are two Hollows hiding behind the wooden barriers ahead, and one
                    standing near to the archer. To avoid unnecessary arrow damage, you can try to lure the
                    sword-wielding
                    Hollows down the steps you just came from, removing you from the line of sight of the archer and
                    enabling you to defeat them easily. Once done, head across the courtyard, up the stairs and deal
                    with
                    the archer (Note: You may notice, a door on the structure directly under where the archer was
                    shooting.
                    If you have the masterkey, you can enter the space to find a Wooden Shield on the corpse, on the
                    balcony. At the top of the stairs on your left there's a room with a bonfire - but since we have
                    cleared
                    out a lot of enemies it may be best not to use it just yet, but the choice is ultimately yours.
                </p>
                <h2>EXploring Around the First Bonfire</h2>
                <p>
                    <u> Into the fog Pt 2</u> - Head back down to the courtyard to find two spear wielding Undead
                    Soldier, on
                    your
                    left. These guys are tough to take out once their shields are raised, so it is advised that you use
                    a
                    ranged attack to take them out one at a time. Kicking while their guard is up will stagger them and
                    leave them open to attack. If you have any Pyromancies such as the starting fireball pyromancy, or
                    some
                    firebombs, you can kill them with a single shot by standing at a middle distance and lobbing the
                    spell
                    or firebomb so it arcs beneath their shield and hits their legs. This is a useful tactic with many
                    shielded enemies, so it is worth practising a bit by resetting these two soldiers a few times via
                    the
                    bonfire. If you are lucky they may also drop a Hollowed Shield. Just be careful not to be surprised
                    by a
                    sudden spear thrust, as the two soldiers will occasionally turn aggressive or even leap at you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u> Into the fog Pt 3</u> - Once the two spear wielding Hollows are dead, head over and destroy the
                    boxes
                    initially behind them to reveal stairs leading downwards. Down the stairs, the door ahead will lead
                    outside where you will find the Undead Merchant. Before you go talk to him, turn right and just on
                    the
                    other side of the fireplace is an axe wielding Hollow hiding behind some cabinets. Kill him now to
                    ensure your safety when dealing with the merchant. The merchant has some useful items for sale. The
                    Residence Key (if you haven't got the Master Key) and the Bottomless Box are incredibly useful.
                    Other
                    good items he sells include: Firebombs, a Short Bow, and Repair Powder (Note: If you can't afford
                    them,
                    doing few runs from the merchant to the bonfire, collecting the souls of the Harrows you dispatch,
                    to
                    enable your purchases). Also, you can kill the Undead Merchant, which rewards you with the
                    Uchigatana,
                    however it is not recommended as he can sell you a lot more. Head back inside from the merchant's
                    balcony and turn left into a corridor then down the stairs and at the back of the resulting alleyway
                    there will be four shield-less Hollows. Take care of them and continue down the ally to climb the
                    ladder. You'll end up at rooftop where you will find a corpse with Throwing Knives (x10). Straight
                    ahead
                    you will see the doorway with the broken wooden bridge. Where earlier it wasn't possible to run jump
                    onto it, here it is. Once you do, head up the stairs onto the ledge to find Light Crossbow and some
                    Standard Bolts (x16) on a corpse. Jump off this ledge through the gap in the railing and you'll be
                    back
                    on the rooftop where you entered Undead Burg. If you haven't already, you can now proceed to destroy
                    the
                    barrels and the route that follows.
                </p>
                <h2>Beyond the First Bonfire</h2>
                <p>
                    <u> Battlefield</u> - If you head back to the bonfire room, on your left there is a bridge, but be
                    warned
                    that
                    there will be three FireBomber Hollows at you from above (one is behind the church tower) as you
                    approach and cross it. You can try and shoot them out if you have a crossbow or a bow, but that may
                    take
                    some practice so it's highly recommended to just sprint through and keep as far right as possible.
                    Once
                    you enter the doorway at the other end, you'll be out of range of the fire bombs but will encounter
                    two
                    axe Hollows and an Undead Soldier (sword). Also be aware that one or two of the firebomb hollows
                    from
                    earlier may have dropped down here. (Note: This door will already be open the next time you come
                    here
                    and you should travel a small section of the bridge to lure the undead soldier across the bridge
                    toward
                    you and once he is gone you can then proceed onwards and get rid of the axe hollows.) You will also
                    notice a locked gate in this room that you will be able to unlock it a bit later from Lower Undead
                    Burg.

                    Head out the door and take the next door on your right into a building. On your immediate right a
                    Hollow
                    will attack. Go straight through to reveal another armed Hollowon your immediate left. Back in the
                    first
                    room will be some stairs to another room on the left. In here, a chest holds Black Firebombs (x5).
                    Head
                    back outside and ascend the stairs on the right into an area with three more aggro Hollows, one of
                    which
                    throws Firebombs. After you have disposed of them, there will be a ladder to the left of the stairs
                    you
                    came from. Once ascended, you'll find the three Firebombers that tried to kill you earlier when
                    crossing
                    the bridge, and you can kindly return the favour. There will be a corpse up here with Soul of a Lost
                    Undead. Head back down the ladder and enter the small tower on your left to silence the archer
                    Hollow
                    atop.

                    Back downstairs there is a building on your right that you can unlock with the Residence Key (or the
                    Master Key). Head through to find a chest containing Gold Pine Resin (x3). If you have a ranged
                    weapon,
                    you can take care of the three Undead Soldiers that are visible from here. If not, drop down off the
                    ledge here and engage them. Here you will see some stairs leading down, and some leading up:

                    The Darkest Knight Brings The Lightest Loot - The downward stairs lead to the intimidating sight of
                    a
                    Black Knight, but luckily he has his back to you. At such an early stage in the game these guys are
                    tough, but if you are feeling brave you can attempt to take him on - be warned however that at low
                    levels a straight melee fight will be a challenge. If you lure him out and run back to the ladder
                    that
                    lead up to the firebomb Hollows, he won't be able to follow you up the ladder and will give you an
                    opportunity to kill him through ranged attacks - firebombs work well for all character types. If you
                    have experienced summons with you, they may also be able to handle him for you. He will drop a
                    Titanite
                    Chunk and possibly other valuable items such as a Black Knight Sword or Shield once killed. Past
                    where
                    you met the Black Knight you will find the Blue Tearstone Ring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u> Undead Donkey Kong</u> - The upward stairs leads toward a tower, but proceed carefully because
                    at the
                    top
                    there is an Undead Soldier waiting to roll a flaming barrel down the stairs once you take the second
                    flight of stairs. There is a broken section in the wall you can drop down (carefully) to avoid the
                    trap
                    - once the trap is set off, it does not reset. Alternatively, go just far enough up the stairs to
                    set
                    off the rolling barrel, and then run back down around the corner. Once the trap is sprung and the
                    Undead
                    Soldier is defeated, head up the stairs into the tower.
                </p>
                <h2>The Taurus Demon's Tower</h2>
                <p>
                    <u> Rock Bottom</u> - Inside the tower you'll find a door straight ahead of you that can be opened
                    with the
                    Master Key but it's best to avoid this area for now because Havel The Rock is waiting downstairs,
                    although if you have summoned spirits with you it is worth a try. Even if you manage to defeat him,
                    there's only a locked door down here (it opens as a shortcut between Undead Burg and Darkroot Basin
                    later in the game), so you will have to go up to proceed regardless of if you decide to take him on
                    or
                    not. Note: If you do decide to try your luck with our friend Havel, be weary. If he hits you with
                    his
                    weapon, which is a dragon's tooth - yeah, you're in trouble -, you are dead regardless of your
                    shield,
                    or anything; conserve your stamina and use it to mainly roll out of the way of his attacks.
                </p>
                <p><u> Mess With The Bull...</u> - Head up the stairs until you are two floors up from the tower's
                    entrance and
                    then
                    take out the barrels here to reveal a Crystal Lizard which you should quickly dispatch to receive
                    some
                    Twinkling Titanite and another random Titanite drop. Proceed to the fog gate and through it, find
                    yourself on some battlements with another gate at the end, but don't cross the bridge yet. Ascend
                    the
                    ladder on your immediate right instead to find two Hollow archers (with swords) that will attack you
                    once you reach the top. Kill them then go back down again and start crossing over. About three
                    quarters
                    of the way across the bridge, a monster will come crashing down in front of you...</p>
                <h2>Meeting Solaire</h2>
                <p>
                    <u> Sun Of A Gun</u> - After defeating the Taurus Demon, head through the fog gate at the end of the
                    boss
                    arena.
                    There are stairs leading down but before heading down, destroy the boxes at the end to find a Large
                    Soul
                    of a Lost Undead. At the bottom, you will see the locked door that will lead you to Lower Undead
                    Burg -
                    you'll find the key later. To your left there's a wide and long bridge with some enemies on it, and
                    if
                    you continue to the right you'll find Solaire of Astora out on the platform looking at the sun.
                    Praise
                    the Sun! If you answer YES to all his questions he will give you White Sign Soapstone - giving you
                    the
                    ability to join co-op with other players to help take on bosses in their world.

                <h2>The Wyvern Bridge</h2>
                <p>
                    Can You Handle The Heat? - Go back to the long bridge with the enemies and proceed across it. If the
                    Drake is not at the end, it will come flying from behind - either way, there will be loads of fire
                    when
                    you are about halfway across the bridge. There are two openings ahead, one on the left and another
                    on
                    the right. The one on the right has some stairs going down - that is the one you want to aim for.
                    Raise
                    your shield and start running towards the stairs on the right of the bridge, hugging the right side
                    of
                    the bridge as you go. Ignore the enemies but avoid the arrows since they will slow you down. As
                    mentioned, about halfway across the Drake will spew fire, killing all the enemies (and hopefully not
                    you). Hint: The Heater Shield (purchasable from the Undead Merchant in Undead Burg) and its
                    increased
                    fire resistance may prove useful here if you are having difficulty making it across. Head down the
                    stairs and you will see two doors. One leads under the bridge and the other is a shortcut to your
                    last
                    visited bonfire. Take the one back to the bonfire first and note that you will need to kick down a
                    ladder to open a way back up. IMPORTANT: Make sure you kick down the ladder first to open the
                    shortcut
                    for good. Once this is done, go back up and take the other door that leads under the bridge.

                    Down here you can obtain a weapon that's very useful for low level characters: the Drake Sword. You
                    obtain it by shooting the Drake's tail multiple times with arrows from below the bridge on the right
                    side until it breaks off. Note: Once done, you should be aware that there are three ways you can
                    proceed. One way will allow you to go under the bridge, ignoring the Drake and the other two ways
                    will
                    require you to either run past or kill the Drake, but these methods will open up a shortcut to the
                    Undead Parish, a bonfire and a covenant (the Warrior of Sunlight covenant - read up on this covenant
                    to
                    find out how to join):
                </p>
                <p>
                    Method 1 - Under the Bridge: While under the bridge, go around the pillars. Past the second one an
                    Undead Soldier (sword) lurks. Take the path to the left of the last pillar and you will see a Undead
                    Soldier (spear) patrolling. Past him you will see a door leading into a room. This part can be
                    tricky
                    since three poisonous sewer rats will rush you (and possibly knock you off the edge if you're not
                    careful). Either try lure them out or rush inside and get rid of them. They are poisonous, so
                    proceed
                    with caution and keep that shield up. (Should you get poisoned, don't freak out. Being poisoned will
                    only drain HP slowly, so if you just keep an eye on your health and use flasks when you need to you
                    should be okay. Return to the bonfire to remove the poison and try again) Once inside the rat room,
                    you
                    can climb a ladder on your left to reach the Undead Parish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Method 2 - Running Past the Drake on top of the Bridge: You can brave a sprint straight through to
                    the
                    passage below where the Wyvern sits, but this might be a tall order and having high fire resistance
                    is
                    recommended. So if you sprint from the top of the stairs on the bridge towards the other safe zone
                    on
                    the left side, it will usually cause the Drake to breathe fire, helping you with any remaining
                    Hollows
                    in the area. Then simply wait in the other safe zone until the Drake gets bored (usually takes no
                    more
                    than 20 seconds) and it will leap down onto the bridge. Alternatively, shooting an arrow at it from
                    the
                    stairs will make it leap down right away. The second it does this, quickly bolt through its legs
                    towards
                    the doorway behind it. It's worth trying to pick up the Claymore on the corpse on the right as you
                    run.
                    If you make it through it is possible that the Drake may turn around and breathe fire into that
                    area, so
                    if you want to be safe you can hang a sharp right in the passage and run out the door here. Pulling
                    the
                    lever in there will make the Drake fly away and open a shortcut to Undead Parish. There is also a
                    bonfire in here and a doorway leading to the covenant mentioned above. Enter the Undead Parish
                    through
                    the newly-opened gate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Method 3 - Defeating the Drake: There are a number of ways to kill the Hellkite Drake (as further
                    detailed on its discussion page), including moving to the left side under the bridge and shooting it
                    in
                    the neck with arrows as it patrols back and forth. (With the Patch this method has been fixed, the
                    Drake
                    heals, when health drops by 25%.) However, if you prefer melee, then what follows is also a viable
                    option - but will likely take a few tries to perfect, so don't be discouraged if you die a few
                    times.
                    Stand at the top of the stairs to the side of the bridge so you can see the Drake's head, shoot it
                    with
                    an arrow to make it jump down and then ready your preferred weapon (ideally the Drake Sword),
                    holding it
                    two-handed. As soon as the arrow hits (and not before) start running out to the middle of the bridge
                    and
                    do a jump attack. The Drake will have come down to you by the time your strike lands and it will
                    hopefully hit him right in the head, taking off a chunk of his health. As soon as you can, run back
                    and
                    down the stairs to avoid his attack and wait down there for him to go back up to his perch. Repeat
                    this
                    process a few times and he'll eventually expire, giving you a load of souls, allowing you to
                    traverse
                    bridge at your leisure, letting you pick up the items and get to the room at the back to access the
                    bonfire and covenant. Pull the lever and go through the gate to enter the Undead Parish.


                    Whichever method you decide to use, you'll be at the Undead Parish once you're done.

                <p>The Undead Parish is a location in Dark Souls and Dark Souls Remastered. Here you will find the first
                    Bell of Awakening. This area can be reached via Undead Burg initially or via Firelink Shrine (once
                    you
                    unlock the elevator) and it's also the gateway to Darkroot Garden and Sen's Fortress. </p>
                <p>Welcome To The Undead Parish - Whether you've entered this area via the ladder that came from the
                    Upper
                    Undead Burg or through the portcullis that you may have opened behind the Wyvern, both entrances are
                    very close to each other - taking the passage to the right from the portcullis you'll find the
                    ladder.
                    At the ladder entrance there is a spiral staircase leading up a tower on your left. If you follow it
                    up
                    you'll find a Black Knight at the top, however a toe-to-toe fight right now would be ill-advised and
                    revisiting it in the near future would be better suited.
                </p>
                <p>Turn right as you exit the doorway to see an Undead Soldier (Sword) waiting on top of some stairs.
                    Past
                    this first undead, a courtyard containing a new monster in the distance - the Fang Boar - among some
                    other, more regular, Undead Soldiers. You will note two Archer Hollows on a ledge behind the boar,
                    as
                    well as two Undead Soldiers on each side of the beast. There is another Undead Soldier (Spear) and
                    some
                    stairs on your right. At the far back, there's also another Undead Soldier under the ledge with the
                    archers on it. You will be able to lure the one enemy next to the Boar as well as the spear soldier
                    on
                    your right. Triggering the Soldier on the left will cause him to run back and pull a lever to drop
                    the
                    portcullis at the end of the courtyard, behind the boar. Once you have killed all immediate threats,
                    make your way to the archers by heading up the stairs on your right and taking care of the undead as
                    you
                    go along (Note: Once you get upstairs you will have to deal with a spear wielding Undead Soldier and
                    two
                    archers. Taking out the archers first may make the battle easier). The remaining soldier, behind the
                    boar, will likely come chasing after you while you're up here, so there's no need to go downstairs
                    to
                    get him. You will find Alluring Skull, an item you can use to bait the Fang Boar, on the ledge past
                    the
                    archers.</p>
                <p><u>Pork Roast</u> - With all the undead dealt with, now it's just you and the Fang Boar. You should
                    be able
                    to
                    dispose of it while you are upstairs by using spells, arrows or dropping some firebombs on it, and
                    may
                    drop the Fang Boar Helm once defeated, if you're lucky. For a straight fight with it, try to stay to
                    it's sides with your shield up to avoid getting hit and attack when it's not attacking. If you go to
                    it's rear end you'll be able to perform a backstab also, but beware that it has a rear kick that's
                    quite
                    painful if you don't successfully perform the backstab in time. Alternatively, if you happen to be
                    fast
                    enough to follow the enemy that closes the portcullis, and if the boar is under it as it closes
                    it'll
                    kill the boar instantly. You don't actually even need to touch the boar, you can bait it into
                    charging
                    through the two burning stacked corpses found in the area, and it'll take considerable damage for
                    the
                    long period of time it's stunned after the charge while standing in the fire.</p>
                <p><u>The Black Knight Returns</u> - Once the courtyard is cleared, now is the time to take on the Black
                    Knight
                    that we ignored earlier. Go back to where you left him and confront him - and by confront him, we
                    mean
                    lead him to his own demise. Once he's following you, lead him back down to the courtyard and toward
                    one
                    of the fires present here - the one further away is recommended. Ensure the fire stays between you
                    and
                    the Black Knight and he will continuously burn himself while trying to attack you. Keep this
                    strategy up
                    and before long he'll die and drop a Titanite Chunk without even taking a single swing at him. Easy
                    money.</p>
                <h2>Parish Basement and Grounds</h2>
                <p><u>>Hollow-Round Me Are Familiar Faces</u> - Go to the end of the courtyard and descend the stairs on
                    the
                    right.
                    Here you will see a Hollow starting to run away from you, leading you into an ambush - so beware.
                    The
                    first room will have two more Hollows, one on either side. Lure them out to deal with them. Up the
                    stairs there are 3 more waiting to ambush you. The Hallow that ran from before will jump-attack you
                    from
                    the left, so be careful. In total two Hollows on the left plus the one on the right. Once up the
                    stairs,
                    you will see a small area at the back, as well as another hostile Hallow. Kill it and find the
                    Mystery
                    Key on the corpse on the other side of the table. Heading back up the few steps to find a ladder on
                    your
                    left. Climb it to find two more Hollows to fight. Next to the ladder you will note a body hanging on
                    a
                    beam. You can carefully walk over the beams to find a Large Soul of a Lost Undead. Climb the second
                    ladder where you'll find a room with a fog gate to your right. Enter the fog gate and you'll find
                    yourself on a walkway above the initial courtyard that you fought through earlier. </p>

                <p><u>At A Crossroads</u> - Cross the walkway and you will reach a T-junction. Going right you will see
                    the
                    back of
                    an Undead Knight. You have the advantage on this one to sneak up and backstab him, but be warned; he
                    is
                    able to counter your strikes, so jump attacks are very useful. Past him you will find a Knight
                    Shield.
                    Going left, you will find some more stairs and an Undead Soldier (Spear), on your left. Head
                    straight
                    through the passage until you come across another T-junction, but don't venture out of the passage.
                    On
                    your right is another Undead Soldier (Spear) and on your left, an Undead Knight (this one will be
                    facing
                    you, so use extreme caution). You can try to lure the Undead Soldier but it is very hard to do so
                    without aggravating the knight on the other side; I recommend to run to the left and try to behind
                    so
                    the Undead Knight is in between yourself and the Undead Soldier, this is because the Soldier is much
                    more defensive than the knight and will buy the knight enough time to box you in and kill you. The
                    narrow corridor makes for a tricky fight but firebombs also work great as a counter attack. Head
                    down
                    the corridor and make a note of the passage on the left - we will come back here soon. Go straight
                    forward and down the stairs where you will find two Undead Soldiers and an Undead Archer. After
                    killing
                    them, you should notice a doorway to the left and a passage on the right. The doorway is a side
                    entrance
                    to the parish but we head right for now, we'll come back to it later.</p>
                <h2>The Old Church</h2>
                <p><u>Reinforcements</u> - At the end of this passage you'll enter an old church and down the stairs
                    here you
                    will
                    find a bonfire (which is worth kindling as you will use this one a lot throughout the game) and a
                    doorway leading to the currently locked gates of Sen's Fortress, they lead you to Siegmeyer of
                    Catarina
                    - a jolly soul wearing rather cumbersome looking onion-shaped armour. He's waiting patiently for the
                    gates to open and you'll meet him again inside Sen's Fortress once the gates are unlocked. Head down
                    the
                    stairs at the bonfire to meet Blacksmith Andre of Astora (He can upgrade weaponry on the standard,
                    raw,
                    divine and occult paths, once you obtain the correct prerequisites) and another doorway, guarded by
                    a
                    Titanite Demon, leading down to Darkroot Garden.</p>
                <h2>The Parish (Ground Floor)</h2>
                <p><u>This Is Later</u> - Trackback to the second T-section from earlier, and take a left instead to
                    access the
                    front entrance of the parish. Inside the doorway of the church, on your right, you can see two
                    Undead
                    Knights. As soon as you approach the door one of them will start coming for you, so give the doorway
                    a
                    wide-berth if you want to avoid a fight for the moment. Beware of a third Knight lurking behind the
                    door
                    on the left. Right at the back near the alter you'll see the Tower Knight. Try lure them one at a
                    time
                    and remember to collect the Halberd and Basement Key (to allow access to Lower Undead Burg) from the
                    two
                    corpses outside, don't forget to deal with the Undead Soldier that locked you out to begin with and
                    make
                    him pay! Pulling the lever will open the portcullis back to the courtyard at the beginning of the
                    area.
                    Note: If you reset with a bonfire and access via the original route, the pesky Undead Soldier will
                    trigger the lever again, resetting the shortcut. This Is Later - Trackback to the second T-section
                    from
                    earlier, and take a left instead to access the front entrance of the parish. Inside the doorway of
                    the
                    church, on your right, you can see two Undead Knights. As soon as you approach the door one of them
                    will
                    start coming for you, so give the doorway a wide-berth if you want to avoid a fight for the moment.
                    Beware of a third Knight lurking behind the door on the left. Right at the back near the alter
                    you'll
                    see the Tower Knight. Try lure them one at a time and remember to collect the Halberd and Basement
                    Key
                    (to allow access to Lower Undead Burg) from the two corpses outside, don't forget to deal with the
                    Undead Soldier that locked you out to begin with and make him pay! Pulling the lever will open the
                    portcullis back to the courtyard at the beginning of the area. Note: If you reset with a bonfire and
                    access via the original route, the pesky Undead Soldier will trigger the lever again, resetting the
                    shortcut. </p>
                <p> <u>The Big Knight</u> - Time to kill the Tower Knight. Instead of heading into the parish from the
                    front
                    entrance, it is much safer to use the side entrance along the path that leads to Andre. Once you go
                    in,
                    the Tower Knight will be standing next to the altar on your right. Consider luring him out the side
                    entrance to give yourself some room for the fight - his attack***** pretty hard but are slow and he
                    shouldn't prove too difficult if you have room to manoeuvre. He drops a Titanite Shard once defeated
                    and
                    doesn't respawn.</p>
                <p><u>It's A Small World</u> - On the altar you will find a Fire Keeper Soul - DO NOT use it and keep it
                    for
                    your
                    impending return to Firelink Shrine. Turn around now so your back's to the alter and look up and
                    you'll
                    notice a new enemy up on a balcony - a Channeler. He shouldn't notice you from down here but once he
                    does
                    he'll fire soul arrows at you, and is able to buff the enemies around him. Making it a good idea to
                    take
                    him
                    out now rather than later. So if you have a bow you should attempt to do so from here - a head shot
                    will
                    stagger him and not allow him to fire off a soul arrow and a few consecutive hits will take him out.
                    Once
                    he's dead he won't respawn. Now, facing the same way head right to find two elevators and a flight
                    of
                    stairs
                    leading upwards on the right. Permanently open a new shortcut to Firelink Shrine by activating the
                    lift.
                    (NOTE: This is also the elevator you will use to gain access to the Northern Undead Asylum again.)
                    While
                    in
                    Firelink Shrine, take this opportunity to upgrade your Estus Flask. Go down the discreetly placed
                    stairs
                    to
                    the left of the Crestfallen Warrior, talk to Anastacia of Astora (the woman behind the bars) and use
                    your
                    newly acquired Fire Keeper Soul to reinforce your Estus Flask - this will refill more HP when you
                    use
                    it.
                    Head back up to the Undead Parish the same way you came in.</p>
                <h2>The Parish(First Floor and Roof)</h2>
                <p><u>The Horde</u> - After ascending the elevator again, turn left and go up the stairs where you'll
                    meet
                    another
                    around the corner. Follow the passage until you see a big room ahead. DO NOT enter this room - there
                    is
                    a
                    horde of Hollows that will come chasing after you (and if you didn't take out the Channeler earlier
                    on
                    then
                    he can make them more powerful, so caution is advised). Lure the zombies into the corridor to limit
                    the
                    horde's effectiveness and provide a steady and manageable stream of zombies to take on (once they're
                    all
                    disposed of, go into the room and kill the Channeler if you have not already done so).</p>
                <p>
                    <u>Freedom</u> - Once inside the room, there are passages ahead of you on the right and left of the
                    room
                    and
                    there's also one on the left behind you. Take the one on the left in front of you t to find a small
                    room
                    with a Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier on a corpse. Heading out the same way you entered and
                    straight
                    through the doorway into a corridor with stairs at the end of it, you'll come across an Undead
                    Soldier
                    at
                    the top of the resulting stairs. Get him out of the way and head up the stairs, following the
                    passage to
                    the
                    end where you will find a corpse in a barrel, break it to reveal its Humanity. Head back and you
                    will
                    see
                    light passing through some wooden boards on your left. Break through, climb the stairs to find
                    Knight
                    Lautrec of Carim locked in a cell. The Mystery Key you picked up earlier can help you free him, if
                    you
                    wish;
                    choosing to do will allow you to find him at Firelink Shrine, sitting down near Anastacia's cell and
                    if
                    you
                    talk to him you'll then be able to use his services for the Parish boss fight (see Lautrec's page
                    for
                    more
                    details). Finally head back to the room of the horde and take the unexplored passage on the right.
                    Head
                    up
                    the ladders to find the fog gate, that leads to the Big Boss.
                </p>
                <p>Note: Before you go through the fog gate to face the boss, it should be noted that if you're in human
                    form
                    you have the opportunity to summon some help. If you met Solaire in Undead Burg and if you also
                    freed
                    Lautrec and then talked to him back in Firelink Shrine you will find their summon signs on the
                    ground
                    nearby
                    the fog gate, so look around.</p>
                <p><u>Quasimodo</u> - Once the boss fight is complete, climb to the top of the tower head to ring the
                    first
                    Bell of
                    Awakening and receive six Homeward Bones, but resist the urge to use one. Instead head back down
                    again
                    to
                    meet Oswald of Carim. It's advised that you buy some Purging Stones from him before you leave if
                    possible -
                    the last thing you want is to have to trek back here to buy them when you need them. The next
                    destination is
                    Lower Undead Burg, which you can access through the locked door at the other end of the Wyvern
                    bridge.

                <p>The Depths is an area in Dark Souls and Dark Souls Remastered, accessed from Lower Undead Burg. The
                    door leading down to it is unlocked by the Key to Depths, which is obtained by beating the Capra
                    Demon. It serves as the gateway to Blighttown once you defeat the area's boss.</p>

                <h3>BEFORE YOU BEGIN THIS AREA, PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>You will find many Sewer Rats here and you will likely need a cure for poison, which you can
                        pick-up
                        from dead Ents in Darkroot, or alternatively, you can purchase from the Undead Merchant
                        (female).
                    </li>
                    <li>You will find a new enemy; the Basilisk. They spew a gas which will kill and curse you if you
                        stay
                        in it for too long. Being cursed is a dire situation to be in and it's advised that you know
                        more
                        about the cursed status, how to improve your resistance to it and how to remove it before you
                        begin.
                        You can find further information on the cursed status here. High curse resistance gear such as
                        the
                        Antiquated Set can be extremely helpful.</li>
                    <li>
                        There is the very high chance you will become toxified so be sure to stock up on blooming purple
                        moss clumps.

                </ol>
                <h2>The Kitchen</h2>
                <p>
                    <u>The Depths</u>- The Depths can be accessed once you obtain the key from the Capra Demon,
                    backtrack to
                    the door we found earlier before entering the fog gate to battle the demon. Head down the stairs,
                    through the door, to find three Hollows - one will try to surprise you from behind on your right,
                    once
                    you've descended. After killing them, follow the direction of which the surprise Hollow came from,
                    all
                    the way back to acquire a Soul of a Nameless Soldier on a corpse behind a few boxes. Turn around and
                    head to the end of the hallway, where there is a doorway on the left. Coming down the stairs, you
                    should
                    notice three Torch Hollows ahead as well as two more Hollows hiding behind the pillars. There will
                    also
                    be one more Hollow on the left of the stairs you came from. If you notice on the left of the
                    railing,
                    you should see a Butcher going about her business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u>What's Cooking, Good Looking?</u> - You should be able to dent in her health (substantially) with
                    strong
                    ranged attacks, but you can also aggravate her from up here before you even get a shot off, so don't
                    be
                    surprised if she brings the fight to you. Once make your way down to the kitchen, an Undead Attack
                    Dog
                    will stand at the foot of the steps, while another waits at the butchers table (the one beside the
                    table
                    does not respawn). Lure the Butcher before proceeding (if you haven't already triggered her). You
                    will
                    find a chest, next to the Butcher's table, containing the Large Ember. There are some boxes which
                    you
                    can break behind the table to reveal a small passage that leads to a hole in the ground, but don't
                    go
                    down there yet; make a note of the hole and head down into the water instead. The hole drops you
                    down
                    onto a ledge with a Spider Shield, above the Giant Rat.
                </p>
                <q><i>Note: There is a shorter route to the end of the Depths that you can access at this point. But
                        doing
                        so
                        will skip a huge portion of the area and it's items and possibly leave you at a disadvantage
                        during
                        the
                        boss battle. Please see the 'Shortcut' section below this walkthrough for further
                        information.</i></q>
                <p>
                    <u>Helping Hand</u> - Down in the water you'll find two Undead Attack Dogs and a Hollow waiting.
                    Make
                    use of
                    your
                    ranged attacks to dispose of them and then make your way up the pile of rubble down there, then head
                    through
                    the hole in the wall. A second Butcher will be standing on beams above you to the left, as you
                    ascend
                    the
                    rubble into the hallway. Use ranged attacks for an easy kill or bait her cleaver attacks for a
                    backstab.
                    Heading through the door she was standing over will lead you to a large room filled with barrels -
                    Laurentius is trapped in one of them, in the corner of the room. After speaking, with him roll into
                    the
                    barrels to destroy them, to prevent any accidental harm to him while freeing him. Once done he'll
                    now
                    appear
                    in Firelink Shrine as a pyromancy trainer. Head back and continue down the corridor, but be wary of
                    the
                    second Butcher coming from behind if you have not already fought her - you will hear her drop down
                    if
                    you
                    haven't killed her yet (NOTE: The door leading to the sewers can be used to kill the second butcher
                    easily
                    if you are having trouble; lure the butcher to stand outside the door and close it, where she will
                    remain
                    and your attacks will still deal damage through the door. Beware that the butcher can likewise hit
                    you
                    through the door as well so just hit her once then step back, let her attack then hit her again).
                    Move
                    through the door at the end of the hall to make your way down the stairs to the sewers.
                </p>
                <h2>Entering The Sewers</h2>
                <p><u>Slimy Sewers</u> - Once you enter the water, at the bottom of the stairs you'll see a corpse on
                    your left
                    with an item. DO NOT inspect it just yet as a Slime is hovering above and has a good chance to kill
                    if it falls on you; you can force it to drop with a single arrow or by very slowly moving towards
                    the corpse until it drops ahead of you. Once its on ground level, it is easy to dispose of. Also, be
                    wary of the Torch Hollow that's in the passage ahead as he can sneak up on you if you're not paying
                    attention. Once it's clear, the baited corpse has a Soul of a Nameless Soldier. Continue until you
                    reach a corridor that extends to the right with a Torch Hollow on the opposite end. At this point it
                    is highly recommended that you dispose of that Torch Hollow with a ranged weapon (if available) as a
                    load of Slimes are on the ceiling between you and the undead. You can target some, but not all, of
                    the slimes with arrows or spells as they cling to the ceiling. Or you can sprint past them and deal
                    with them once they've grounded. If you're sprinting - be sure to hug the left side of the wall
                    (facing the Torch Hollow) to avoid any dropping slimes- then it's extra important that you don't
                    have to deal with the Torch Hollow, incase things don't go exactly according to plan. At the end of
                    the slime-infested corridor you'll find a door, unlockable with the Master Key to access a bonfire.
                    (HINT: it is actually better to not use it until you have killed the Giant Rat) But if you don't
                    have the Master Key then the key you'll have to wait just a little bit longer to find the
                    alternative key.</p>
                <p>
                    <u>Bonfire Access</u> - Head down the passage next to the bonfire door to find some boxes to your
                    left and
                    a Giant Rat behind the fence - it can't attack you from there, so don't worry. (Tip: If you have a
                    bow, it is possible to kill the Giant Rat from here by shooting arrows through the small gap above
                    the bars. You cannot shoot through the bars, but if you have a spear [the Silver Knight Spear, the
                    Dragonslayer Spear or the Moonlight Butterfly Horn are especially good, but a regular spear, Winged
                    Spear or Partizan etc. will also suffice.] you can also poke him through the bars). The boxes here
                    can be broken to reveal a ladder leading down; there's no need to go down the for the time being -
                    there is only a locked door down there and it only opens from the other side. Keep heading forward
                    until you reach another t-junction. On the right, is a mob of sewer rats guarding a corpse with a
                    Greataxe. (Tip: this is a good location to farm Humanity items once you have access to the nearby
                    bonfire.) Head to the left but be wary of the box at the end of the corridor as a another sewer rat
                    will leap out of it, so hug the right wall as you move towards the box in order to spring the trap
                    but not get injured. Keep going forward and you will spot a rat running away from you. There are a
                    few more more rats down the stairs on the right next to a reachable corpse holding the Sewer Chamber
                    Key - which grants access to the bonfire if you do not have the Master Key.
                </p>
                <h2>Clearing Out the Sewer</h2>
                <p>
                    <u>Pest Control</u> - Turn around and take the path under the stairs you just came down. You will
                    notice a
                    passage on your right with a drain hole towards the end, ignore this for now and head for the corpse
                    in the distance to obtain a Soul of a Nameless Soldier. If you continue around to the right from
                    there, you will find a fog gate, and through it you will see four Sewer Rats and a Channeler
                    patrolling some ramparts that overlook the boss arena. If you want, you can battle them here or you
                    can take a riskier route for an easier fight. The risky route involves heading back to the passage
                    with the drain hole from earlier. A rat in the distance and will require you to jump over the hole
                    to continue, fail to successfully complete the jump, and you will plunge into the Basilisk Tunnels,
                    which will require you to make your way out again. Skip to the 'Basilisk Tunnels' section below for
                    a survival guide.
                </p>
                <q><i>
                        Note: It's highly advised that you kill the Channeler before engaging the boss, or be prepared
                        to be shot at with fire soul arrows at you during the boss fight or even have spell buffs on the
                        boss, which makes that battle unnecessarily hard.</i></q>
                <p><u>Big Rodent Problem</u> - Past the hole is a passage to your right with another rat at the end.
                    Head in
                    that direction to find a corpse with Soul of a Nameless Soldier at a t-junction - to the left
                    there's an easily overlooked gap in the ground which you should avoid, as this one leaves you in the
                    deepest part of the Basilisk Tunnels. Take a right and follow the tunnel to find the Giant Rat. For
                    an easier battle, make your way back to the kitchen and drop down the hole (we ignored earlier)
                    behind the table. You will land on the ledge mentioned earlier for a very easy fight. While on this
                    ledge, go to the far right and make your way around to the other side of the room to find a Spider
                    Shield on a corpse; dropping down to where the Giant Rat roamed, you'll find a Soul of a Nameless
                    Soldier on a corpse.</p>
                <q><i>Note: The shortcut mentioned in an earlier note can also be accessed from the Giant Rat's room.
                        Again, please see the 'Shortcut' section below for more info.</i></q>
                <p>
                    The Final Piece - Head back to the drain hole and continue down the passage until you reach another
                    t-junction. On your left will be the ramparts with the Channeler and his sewer rat friends and to
                    your far right, a slime and the other drain hole on the ground. Once you've cleared all enemies on
                    the ramparts, move further onto them, past the wooden stairs on the left and continue in that
                    direction. The first two boxes on the left after the stairs are concealing two rats, ready to ambush
                    you. Past them, right at the back you will find a corpse behind the last pillar with a Large
                    Titanite Shard. Now it's time to explore the deepest and most dangerous area of the Depths...</p>
                <h2>The Basilisk Tunnels</h2>
                <p><u>Creatures</u> - You can reach the Basilisk Tunnels by dropping down one of the holes in the narrow
                    passages, or by accidentally falling down the middle of the waterfall in the Giant Rat's room. Try
                    dropping down the drain hole you saw first, as this is the safest entry point. You will land next to
                    some stairs and a few Basilisk will come around the corner momentarily (NOTE: Try to stay away from
                    Basilisk they spew as their gas can curse you - please visit the Basilisk's page for detailed
                    insight). Before moving along, climb the stairs behind you to find two basilisk ahead of you, one on
                    your right – be ready for it. Continue through the passage to find a couple more Basilisk and a Soul
                    of a Nameless Soldier on a corpse. Try luring the two Basilisks on your left before proceeding. Go
                    right and take the path to the left. There should be five basilisks hiding under the stairs, however
                    some may have gone aggro and attacked you sooner. You will also find a corpse with a Large Soul of a
                    Nameless Soldier.</p>
                <p>
                    <u>Do You Bleed?</u> - Head back and take the path leading under the stairs where you are to be
                    confronted
                    by two more basilisks, to your left. Follow the path until you reach a corpse with Ring of the Evil
                    Eye. Go back up the stairs and take a left into the doorway above the ground level you can reach by
                    moving along the left side of the wall. Be careful once you enter the doorway because there is a
                    hole in the ground just around the corner but there is a very tempting corpse on the other side of
                    it holding treasure. You will need to start your run-up from the doorway and time the jump well once
                    you turn the corner to obtain the Humanity on the corpse. Make your way back to the hole you fell
                    through originally, its a mini waterfall next to some stairs. Continue down the stairs and follow
                    the passage to until you reach a t-junction. Go left and be ready for the three rats coming around
                    the corner. This is also where Knight Kirk will spawn, if you are in human form, so be ready for a
                    moderately simple fight - just ensure it's a 1-on-1 and watch out for his bleed (NOTE: Make sure you
                    are in human form so he is able to spawn, and you can begin your journey in acquiring his spiked
                    armor). Head up the stairs, and make your way out of these tunnels.
                </p>
                <h2>Route to the Gaping Dragon</h2>
                <p><u>How About A Trade?</u> - At the top of the stairs you will find yourself in a room with three
                    Slimes,
                    one of which is on the ceiling, and two Sewer Rats. To your right lies a passage with a long
                    staircase leading you up to a door. Through the door you will find a room with a ladder, which
                    should be familiar to you. It's the ladder revealed much earlier by breaking the boxes and it lets
                    you gain easy and welcome access to the bonfire. To your left there is passage with stairs leading
                    to the boss fight. There is also an opening through some metal bars on the left, where you will find
                    Domhnall of Zena and the big doors that lead to Blighttown.</p>
                <p>Teeth - Head into the passage that leads to the boss, move to your right and take the stairs down to
                    the lower level. Continue on right and you will then encounter more stairs going down - this takes
                    you to the fog gate, but don't go down them just yet. Go past them and next to the pillar ahead you
                    may see summon signs for both Knight Solaire and Knight Lautrec, on either side of the pillar, if
                    you are in Human form and their quest lines are still open - they will assist greatly with the
                    impending boss fight. Keep going forward past this pillar to find a corpse with Heavy Crossbow and
                    Heavy Bolts behind the corner on the left. Now that you're ready, continue down the stairs until you
                    reach the fog gate...</p>
                <p>Once the boss is defeated you will receive the Blighttown Key and you can safely collect the Warrior
                    Set that's in the boss arena. Go back to the room with Domhnall of Zena to use the key and enter the
                    next area: Blighttown.</p>
                <h2>Shorcut</h2>
                <p>There is a shorter route through the Depths that skips a great deal of the area and leads on to the
                    boss. Beware, doing so without killing the Channeler up on the top level can make the boss fight
                    harder than it needs to be. Please follow the steps below to follow the shorter route:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Behind the table where the first Butcher stands in the Kitchen section, there are boxes hiding a
                        passage that leads to a hole. Go down this hole.</li>
                    <li>You'll then be on the ledge above the Giant Rat's room. Kill the Giant Rat if this is your first
                        trip here and then jump down into the pit where it was.</li>
                    <li>You'll notice a waterfall at the end of the room. Approach the waterfall hugging the left wall
                        and slide down. (It might take an attempt or two to get a hang of it as pillars can nudge you
                        and make you fall if you do not correct your path)</li>
                    <li>
                        You'll land in the room that leads to the Blighttown doors. Work your way to the other end and
                        take a right to go up the stairs to some ramparts. Going down two more flights of stairs will
                        lead you to the boss' fog gate.
                    </li>
                    <li>Step through to fight the Gaping Dragon.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Hints and Farming</h2>
                <p>As you leave the Undead Burg, you will begin your descent into a kitchen area. Fight your way past
                    the Zombies, being careful not to get surrounded, and prepare for a mini boss during your first
                    visit. You will have to fight a Butcher with two giant cleavers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two types of sewer rats, The smaller ones will leave you alone if you keep your distance.
                    The larger ones will attack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both Solaire of Astora and Knight Lautrec can be summoned right before the boss if you are human.
                    They will also follow you around, so you can summon them to help you clear the sewer and kill Kirk,
                    before you fight the boss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are not taking the shortcut, there are a lot of good items and farming opportunities
                    throughout the rest of the sewers. Be on the lookout for holes in the drainage tunnels. You can leap
                    over them, but falling through them often leads to trouble.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Watch out for Basilisks, ballooning up to spit a curse. The mist is an area of effect which will
                    very quickly fill your curse meter, and kill you within a few moments of exposure. Those brittle
                    statues that crumble when you walk through them are victims of the curse. It will cause your health
                    to be halved, and can stack, resulting in 1/4 and then 1/8 of your normal health until your reach a
                    healer later in the game, or use a purging stone from Oswald or the Undead Female Merchant. They
                    cost 3000 or 6000 souls (respectively), so it might be easier to avoid the areas with the Basilisks
                    if you don't have any.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Basilisk Farming Strategy: The Basilisks give 200 souls per kill. If you approach them using the
                    ramps near the boss area/merchant then you don't have to worry about dropping into a bad situation.
                    Be careful, and avoid aggroing groups. You can run back out the empty ramps, and make your way back
                    to the bonfire easily afterwards. You can net 2000-2500 per run. The Basilisks also (since the 1.05
                    patch) drop Eyes of Death fairly often, which are important for the Gravelord Covenant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are also some Slimes, who don't pose too much of a threat if they are on the ground. The real
                    trouble with them is that they can climb on the ceiling, waiting to drop down on you. It is possible
                    to break free should they engulf you by mashing R1 (attack). They are very weak against fire, and
                    drop upgrade stones. One farming technique involves learning a basic pyromancy spell, and finding
                    the bonfire in the depths. When you head straight out from the fire, there are several Slimes on the
                    ceiling ahead of you. Run past them, turn around and flame them all the hell. Pick up any spoils,
                    then return to the bonfire. They will not drop any souls, but as your humanity increases, the
                    upgrade drop rate increases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also possible to farm Sewer Rats here, they have a 1 in 10-20 drop rate of Humanity</p>
